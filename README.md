# Assumptions
- The user wants to access their favorites across devices, i.e. a login is needed. As opposed to simply using e.g. cookies or LocalStorage.

# Missing from MVP
- Salting + hashing passwords
- Email signup + verification
- Password reset
- Elegant error responses from API
- More stringent password requirements

# Nice to haves
- Store favorites locally if user is not logged in, so they can favorite without an account; then sync with server when they log in
