# Assumptions
- The user wants to access their favorites across devices, i.e. a login is needed. As opposed to simply using e.g. cookies or LocalStorage.

# Missing from MVP
- Salting + hashing passwords
- Email signup + verification
- Password reset
- Elegant error responses from API
- More stringent password requirements
